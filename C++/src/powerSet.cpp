/*
    Power Set

    Write a function that takes in an array of unique integers and returns its power set.
    The power set P(x) of a set X is the set of all subsets of X.

    For example the powerset of [1,2] is [[],[1],[2],[1,2]]
    NOTE: the sets in the powerset do not need to be in any particular order

    Sample Input: [1,2,3]
    Sample Output: [[],[1],[2],[3],[1,2],[1,3],[1,2,3]]
